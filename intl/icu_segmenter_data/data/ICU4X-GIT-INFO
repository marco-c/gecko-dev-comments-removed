    Bump everything to ICU4X 2.1.1 (#7191)
    
    I made a small mistake in the release: most crates got published without
    an updated dep on `icu_locale_core` and `icu_provider`. What happened
    was that when I updated crate deps I updated the section for ICU4X
    crates, but those crates are in a different Cargo.toml "section" and
    they didn't get an update (I plan to improve the release checklist to
    avoid this problem in the future, it has never been clear about this
    step).
    
    These crates don't use ~ deps unlike the rest (see
    https://github.com/unicode-org/icu4x/issues/4343), which is why they are
    separate.
    
    This breaks clients who depend directly on a component crate or
    metacrate (say, `icu_calendar`), and they update that: this leads to
    combinations like `icu_locale_core 2.0.0` with `writeable 0.6.2`.
    
    ICU4X 2.0 had broken no-alloc support, which meant that it claimed to
    support no-alloc but in practice it didn't _work_. But the crates
    successfully compiled together. ICU4X 2.1 fixes this. Unfortunately,
    ICU4X 2.1 "fixed" no-alloc crates will not work with ICU4X 2.0 "broken"
    no-alloc crates.
    
    To prevent people from getting inconsistent lockfiles, we just globally
    publish 2.1.1.
    
    A more surgical alternative is to publish 2.1.1 only for component
    crates (not for provider/etc crates which people will not depend on
    directly anyway).
