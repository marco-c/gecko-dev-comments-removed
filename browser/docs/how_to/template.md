# Template to copy

Replace the title with a clear, action-oriented name (e.g., "Adding a Toolbar
Button", "Registering JS Actors").

## Overview

Add a few paragraphs describing what this operation accomplishes and when
developers might need to do it.

## Prerequisites

List what the developer needs before starting:

- Build system set up and working
- Relevant component knowledge or documentation to review
- Any specific tools or extensions needed

## Steps

Break down the operation into clear, sequential steps. Each step should have an
action-oriented title.

### 1. [First Action Step Title]

Describe what needs to be done in this step and why it's necessary.

**Files to modify:**

- `path/to/file1.cpp`
- `path/to/file2.js`

**Code pattern:**

```cpp
// Provide a concrete example of the code to add or modify
// Include enough context to show where it should go
// Use comments to explain non-obvious parts
```

**Explanation:**

Briefly explain what this code does and how it fits into the larger system.

### 2. [Second Action Step Title]

Continue with additional steps...

**Files to modify:**

- `path/to/another/file.jsm`

**Code pattern:**

```javascript
// More example code
```

## Verification

Explain how to verify that the operation was successful:

```bash
./mach build && ./mach run
# or specific test commands
./mach test path/to/relevant/tests/
```

Describe what to look for to confirm success (e.g., "The button should appear in
the toolbar", "Check the Browser Console for the expected log message").

## Common Pitfalls

List common mistakes and their solutions:

- **Issue X**: Brief description of the problem
  - **Solution**: How to fix or avoid it

- **Issue Y**: Another common problem
  - **Solution**: The fix
